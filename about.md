# About Me

I'm **Laura James**, a passionate Computer Science educator and developer based in the UK. With a background in both classroom teaching and software development, I work at the intersection of education and technology.

I design and deliver engaging learning experiences, develop digital tools for learners and teachers, and create content that makes complex CS topics accessible to all. I’ve taught students aged 11–18 and contributed to national curriculum resources, with a focus on programming, web development, and algorithmic thinking.

When I'm not teaching or coding, I love exploring creative tech projects, mentoring students, and contributing to open-source educational tools.
